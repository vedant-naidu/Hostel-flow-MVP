The Heart of the Idea: "HostelFlow"
Living in a college hostel should be about making memories and focusing on studies, but right now, it’s bogged down by outdated paperwork. Every night, hundreds of students stand in lines waiting for a warden to manually tick a box in a register. If a lightbulb fuses, we spend days chasing people to get it fixed. If we need to go home for the weekend, we’re hunting for physical stamps and signatures.

HostelFlow is a smart ecosystem designed by students, for students. It takes the "chaos" of hostel management and turns it into a seamless, digital experience using the Google tools we use every day.

How it changes life in the hostel:
No More Waiting in Line: Instead of a warden physically checking every room, students simply "Check-in" on their phones. The app uses Google Maps Geofencing to make sure the student is actually in the building. It’s fast for the student and effortless for the warden.

Safety without the Stress: When a student needs to leave campus, they get a digital QR-Code Out-Pass. When the guard scans it, the system automatically logs the time. If the student is late or leaving, an automated message can be sent to parents. It provides peace of mind for families without making the student feel "policed."

Fixing Problems Fast: If there’s a leak in a bathroom, a student doesn't have to find the warden. They snap a photo, upload it to the Complaints Portal, and it goes directly to the technician’s dashboard. The warden just monitors the screen to make sure it gets fixed on time.

A Connected Community: It’s hard to know who lives three doors down. The app includes a Privacy-First Directory where students can see names and room numbers, helping us connect with our hostelmates while keeping personal data like phone numbers private.
